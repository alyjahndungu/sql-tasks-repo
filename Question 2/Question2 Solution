Question 2: Since the tables does not have any form of relationship. First step i would do is to introduce a 3rd Normal Form. 

This is basically to join the tables and come up with a third table that has a relationship.


Solution to this looks something like this:


SELECT *
FROM products
RIGHT JOIN uploads
ON products.id = uploads.uploadable_id ORDER BY uploads.file_name ASC;
